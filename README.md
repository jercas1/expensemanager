<strong class="mb-2">From the programmer:</strong>
<p>
Hello, I am Jerry, the examiner of this project. I have created two
versions for the role module which can be found in the following
branches.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>main</strong> branch</li>
<li><strong>rolerevision</strong> branch</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <strong>main</strong> branch follows the role module as the
instruction say (or so I thought) and the the
<strong>rolerevision</strong> branch where the superadmin can select
only which functions can be used for a certain role.
</p>

<p>Please check out my rolerevision version :)</p>

<p>You can try the rolerevision version by switching branch to <strong>rolerevision</strong>. Make sure to run <strong>npm run dev/prod</strong> after switching branch to compile the frontend.</p>

<p>
Also, before using the system, make sure to run the seeder. You can
run it with the command
</p>
<p><strong>php artisan db:seed</strong></p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
